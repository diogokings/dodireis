Hi everyone!!! :octocat:

I'm Diogo Reis from Brazil (🇧🇷) and I'm passionate by technology. Of course I'm, if don't, why should I have a page here in GitHub (Bitbucket and Gitlab too :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:).

I’m currently working at Avenue Code and have been working as back-end developer since 2015, but I also have some knowledge in front-end development. But my tech carrer started in 2007 as a tech/business analyst.

Since that I can't play soccer ⚽️ anymore, one of my favorites hobbies is play RPG (:running: :dragon:), where I can talk about anything with my friends, while drinking a delicious beer. Others things I like to do include watch movies 🎞️ and series 📺, read 📚, listen music 🎵 and travel :airplane: (who don't by the way?).

Would you like to find me?
