Hi everyone!!! :octocat:

I'm Diogo Reis from Brazil (🇧🇷) and I'm passionate by technology. Of course I'm, if don't, why should I have a page here in GitHub (Bitbucket and Gitlab too :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). I've been working as back-end developer since 2015, but I also have some knowledge in front-end development.

I’m currently working at Qintess, an amazing company, knowned in the past as Resource. My nowadays classes are in my graduation as System Analysis and in DevOps course.

Since that I can't play soccer ⚽️ anymore, one of my favorites hobbies is play RPG (:running: :dragon:), where I can talk about anything with my friends, while drinking a delicious beer. Others things I like to do include watch movies 🎞️ and series 📺, read 📚, listen music 🎵 and travel :airplane: (who don't by the way?).

Would you like to find me?
